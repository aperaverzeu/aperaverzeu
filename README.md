### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Java software engineer. As a web backend developer, I specialize in Java 11/17 LTS and the Spring Ecosystem, 
which includes Spring MVC, Data, Security, Cloud, and WebFlux.

I know Git, Docker and Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Postgres, and Apache Cassandra. 
My experience encompasses AWS and GCP, CI/CD workflows, ELK stack, and Angular/Next.js fundamentals. 
I read a lot about Design Patterns and System Design. 

I am interested in Project Management techniques and would like to learn more about Scrum or Agile Leadership. 
Furthermore, I like data analysis and hope to learn Scala or Python in the future. 
I enjoy participating in cultural events and writing science-related articles in my free time.

Feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aperaverzeu/) or via email at aperaverzeu@gmail.com
