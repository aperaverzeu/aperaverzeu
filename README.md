### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Java software engineer. My professional area is web backend development using Java and Spring ecosystem. I work with Java 11 LTS, familiar with Spring MVC, Data, Security, WebFlux and Cloud. Also I have strong knowledge of Git, Mongo, Postgres, Docker, CI/CD process and basic frontend. 

Currently I am learning Java 17 LTS, Kotlin, Kubernetes, AWS, Kafka and ELK stack.
Read a lot about Design Patterns and System Design.
